## Version History (LunarMongoose)
##############################################################################
##
## This version includes support for MongooseMod's custom WorldSizes, Peaks, Features
## and Resources, adds Flood Plains on Plains, and doesn't allow invalid resources to
## be placed in Forests. It now places Scrub and Oases based on rainfall level rather
## than randomly, but the former with a lower minimum amount required, and a slower
## increase in density with higher amounts of rain. Marsh is now placed in tiles with
## extremely high rainfall, using global percents in 3 categories to make sure it
## doesn't use up too much Jungle, and that it shows up enough in cooler regions.
## Coral is now placed in Coast tiles in the tropics, and in Ocean tiles at half the
## normal frequency elsewhere.
##
## 3.2.1 - Changed Jungle temperature requirement from an absolute value to a global
## percent to avoid large amounts of Jungle on maps with a lot of land near the
## equator, and to avoid small amounts of Jungle on maps without much land near the
## equator. Increased minimum distance between Oases from 1 to 2 tiles.
##
## 3.2 - Added AIAndy's square grid evaluation, float division and geostrophic fixes,
## his bonus placement and starting location speed enhancements, and his PythonRandom
## multiplayer support. Added a game option to continue using the old hex-grid-based
## Perlin Noise code if desired, since the previous PW3 landmass shapes are different
## and still fully viable. Merged in the remaining PW 2.0.8 functionality with a game
## option to select the PW2 landmass generator if desired. Changed the rainfall
## thresholds from absolute values to global percents like the temperature thresholds,
## set them to ignore Peaks, and merged the climate system constants back together.
## Enforced the current map's x and y wrap settings in a number of places in the code,
## which fixes some bugs with -1 data values near the edges and should get rivers
## wrapping only when they're supposed to. Fixed natural harbor bug, and added shape
## randomization to natural harbor creation on diagonals. Changed sea ice to vary with
## map size instead of always being 4 tiles thick, and to require water temperature to
## be near freezing so the bands have some limited shape to them. Switched to PW2's
## oversized internal grid when using the PW3 LMG with the PW2 climate system so the
## latter works correctly. Changed the +/- 10% tolerances on elevation, rainfall and
## sea level thresholds to +/- 2%. Removed MeteorCompensationFactor since the system
## does indeed work best without it. (My apologies Ceph; you were right!) Made a
## number of additional code improvements.
##
## 3.1 - Fuyu's 2.0.6f bonus placement, starting location enhancement, minimum hill
## enforcement and bad feature removal code were added, along with his control
## variables. Reverted some more settings for use with vanilla that were still set for
## my mod. Added allowance in getPlotPotentialValue() for clearing features with
## negative food (ie Jungles), since it already accounted for cleared features with
## tile improvements that require it (only useful in mods). Added StartEra checks to
## verify the tech requirements are met for clearing features in both cases. Agreeing
## with Cephalo, I left the starting location production resource food override
## threshold at half the city plots being workable, rather than two-thirds. Changed
## the TechCityTrade requirement for resource valuation and placement to TechReveal
## since the former makes no sense: if a bonus is visible it enhances the tile, and if
## it isn't visible it doesn't enhance the tile, regardless of whether it can be
## harvested or traded with other cities. Added BonusMaxGroupSize option of -1 for
## setting Fuyu's clump limit based on WorldSize, clarified the description of what
## the 0 option there actually does, and fixed the random bounds. Added a minimum
## value to the StartEra checks to include all Classical resources, improvements and
## clearing abilities in the plot valuations. Changed allowWonderBonusChance to allow
## any strategic resource (not just Stone or Marble), and the city sweetener to allow
## non-strategic resources - both up through Classical (or later). Adjusted lake and
## river values again, and added separate controls for them for the two climate
## systems. Increased Desert slightly and Plains considerably in the PW2 system.
## Synchronized the PM3/PW2 code substantially more to make future updates easier.
## Scaled temperature from normal linearly down to zero in the top and bottom thirds
## of the map in the PW3 climate system, to get Tundra and Snow in the higher and
## lower latitudes as there should be. Lowered Tundra/Snow temperatures to compensate.
## Increased PW3 Grassland level slightly.
##
## 3.0 - Initial release of LM's Civ4 Port of Civ5's PW3_v2, using PW_2.06 as base.
## The PW2 HeightMap and ClimateMap have been replaced with their PW3 counterparts.
## PW2's high-altitude randomization was removed since it was causing 80-100%
## of land tiles to be Peaks regardless of settings. PW2's SmallMaps were removed
## since the new Perlin Noise landmass generator does not require an oversized map
## to avoid looking bad. The YToXRatio hex grid scale factor has been removed.
## PW2 control variables that are now unused have been removed, and the necessary
## PW3 ones have been added. Values have also been adjusted as needed or desired.
## MeteorCompensationFactor was added to try and help preserve total land percent
## when using Break Pangaeas. The Sea Level menu option has been enabled, and
## mc.SeaLevelFactor was added to support it. The Use menu option has been added,
## and a slightly-modified version of the PW2 ClimateMap was added back in, to
## support having a choice between the PW2 and PW3 climate systems. PW3's north
## and south attenuation were removed. PW2's code that forced Snow to be at higher
## elevation than Tundra, Tundra to be higher than everything else, and Desert to
## not be, well, something... was removed. Plains in the PW3 ClimateMap were
## set to have a null rainfall window and a relatively large temperature window,
## so that they form exclusively as a result of cold deserts; this helps create
## Great Plains type areas. RiverThreshold's dependence on PlainsPercent (via
## PlainsThreshold) was removed so that its value can be set reliably.

## Version History (Cephalo)
##############################################################################
##
## 3v2 - Shrank the map sizes except for huge. Added a better way to adjust river
## lengths. Used the continent art styles in a more diverse way. Cleaned up the
## mountain ranges a bit.
##
## 3v1 - initial release! 11/24/2010
##
## 2.06 - Fixed a few bugs from my minimum hill/maximum bad feature function.
##
## 2.05 - Made maps of standard size and below a bit smaller. Changed the way I
## remove jungle to prevent excessive health problems. Tiles in FC on different
## continents have zero value. Tiles on different continents will not be boosted
## with resources or hills. Water tiles have zero value for non-coastal cities.
## Water tiles will not be boosted with resources for non-coastal cities, land
## tiles will be boosted instead. (lookout Sid's Sushi!)
##
## 2.04 - Changed many percent values to be a percent of land tiles rather than
## total map tiles for easier, more predictable adjustment. Ensured a minimum
## number of hills in a starting fat cross. Disabled the normalizeRemovePeaks
## function a replaced it with a maximum peaks in FC function. Added bonus
## resources to FC depending on player handicap. Added a value bonus for cities
## placed on river sides.
##
## 2.03 - Fixed an initialization problem related to Blue Marble. Added some
## enhanced error handling to help me track down some of the intermittant bugs
## that still remain.
##
## 2.02 - Fixed some problems with monsoons that were creating strange artifacts
## near the tropics. Added an exponential curve to heat loss due to altitude, so
## that jungles can appear more readily without crawling to inappropriate
## latitudes.
##
## 2.01 - Changed the way I handled a vanilla version difference. Added toroidal
## and flat map options. Made tree amount more easily adjustable. Added a variable to
## tune the level of resource bonuses. Changed the rules for fixing tundra/ice next
## to desert. Added altitude noise to the plate map to improve island chains. Added
## a variable to control heat loss due to high altitude. Implimented a new interleaved
## bonus placement scheme so that bonuses are placed individually in random order,
## rather than all of each bonus type at once. Brought back the meteor code from
## PerfectWorld 1 and eliminated the east/west continent divide.
##
## 2.0 - Rebuilt the landmass and climate model using the FaireWeather.py for
## Colonization map script engine. Improved the river system. Fixed some
## old bugs.
##
## 1.13 - Fixed a bug where starting on a goody hut would crash the game.
## Prevented start plots from being on mountain peaks. Changed an internal
## distance calculation from a straight line to a path distance, improving
## start locations somewhat. Created a new tuning variable called
## DesertLowTemp. Since deserts in civ are intended to be hot deserts, this
## variable will prevent deserts from appearing near the poles where the
## desert texture clashes horribly with the tundra texture.
##
## 1.12 - Found a small bug in the bonus placer that gave bonuses a minimum
## of zero, this is why duel size maps were having so much trouble.
##
## 1.11 - limited the features mixing with bonuses to forests only. This
## eliminates certain undesireable effects like floodplains being erased by
## or coinciding with oil or incense, or corn appearing in jungle.
##
## 1.10 - Wrapped all map constants into a class to avoid all those
## variables being loaded up when PW is not used. Also this makes it a
## little easier to change them programatically. Added two in-game options,
## New World Rules and Pangaea Rules. Added a tuning variable that allows
## bonuses with a tech requirement to co-exist with features, so that the
## absence of those features does not give away their location.
##
## 1.09 - Fixed a starting placement bug introduced in 1.07. Added a tuning
## variable to turn off 'New world' placement.
##
## 1.08 - Removed the hemispheres logic and replaced it with a simulated meteor
## shower to break up pangeas. Added a tuning variable to allow pangeas.
##
## 1.07 - Placing lakes and harbors after river placement was not updating river
## crossings. Resetting rivers after lake placement should solve this. Fixed a
## small discrepancy between Python randint and mapRand to make them behave the
## same way. Bonuses of the same bonus class, when forced to appear on the
## same continent, were sometimes crowding each other off the map. This was
## especially problematic on the smaller maps. I added some additional, less
## restrictive, passes to ensure that every resource has at least one placement
## unless the random factors decide that none should be placed. Starting plot
## normalization now will place food if a different bonus can not be used due
## to lack of food. Changed heightmap generation to more likely create a
## new world.
##
## 1.06 - Overhauled starting positions and resource placement to better
## suit the peculiarities of PerfectWorld
##
## 1.05 - Fixed the Mac bug and the multi-player bug.
##
## 1.04a - I had unfairly slandered getMapRand in my comments. I had stated
## that the period was shortened unnecessarily, which is not the case.
##
## 1.04 - Added and option to use the superior Python random number generator
## or the getMapRand that civ uses. Made the number of rivers generated tunable.
## Fixed a bug that prevented floodplains on river corners. Made floodplains
## in desert tunable.
##
## 1.03a - very minor change in hope of finding the source of a multi-player
## glitch.
##
## 1.03 - Improved lake generation. Added tuning variables to control some
## new features. Fixed some minor bugs involving the AreaMap filler
## and fixed the issue with oasis appearing on lakes. Maps will now report
## the random seed value that was used to create them, so they can be easily
## re-created for debugging purposes.
##
## 1.02 - Fixed a bug that miscalculated the random placing of deserts. This
## also necessitated a readjustment of the default settings.
##
## 1.01 - Added global tuning variables for easier customization. Fixed a few
## bugs that caused deserts to get out of control.

River, Lake, Feature and Resource placement remain unchanged from PerfectWorld 2, with updated Sea Ice placement. This version includes support for MongooseMod's custom WorldSizes, Peaks, Features and Resources, adds Flood Plains on Plains, and doesn't allow invalid resources to be placed in Forests. It also uses the DLL's starting plot evaluator, which runs much faster and includes a lot of BetterAI work by Fuyu and others."
